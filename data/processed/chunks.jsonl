(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as i f the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention. (7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly b y an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. Illustration . A intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by beating Z. A has committed murder. (8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Illustrations . (a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. (b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, inten ding to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.

A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his off ice, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s death.

(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act. Illustration . A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation t hat his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill -will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z ’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide. CHAPTER II OF PUNISHMENTS Punishments. 4.

Illustration . A is sentenced to a fine of one thousand rupees and to four months’ imprisonment in default of payment. Here, if seven hundred and fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the first month has expired.

Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. Illustration . A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court to apprehend Z.

Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. Illustrations . (a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. (b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. Illustrations . (a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence. (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z’s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z’s death. Here, tho ugh B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. (c) A instigate s B to set fire to a dwelling -house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A’s instigation. B has commi tted no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling -house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence. (d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z’s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A’s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft.

B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence. Illustration . A instigates B to ins tigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also l iable to the same punishment. Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in purs uance of which the offence is committed. Illustration . A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioni ng A’s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been enga ged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. Abetment in India of offences outside India . 47.

Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causin g such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. Illustrations . (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing deat h, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intend ing to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z’s death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.

Illustrations . (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. (b) A, knowing that Z is labo uring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword -cut or club -wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z’s death. (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is gui lty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. Exception 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self -control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the deat h of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident: Provided that the provocation is not, - (a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person; (b) giv en by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant; (c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of", "source": "data\\raw\\BNS_Part1.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "BNS_Part1.pdf"}

Explanation .—Whether the provocation was gra ve and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. Illustrations . (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z’s child. This is murder, in as much as the provoc ation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending n or knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, an d kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A’s deposition, and that A ha s perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. (e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without an y intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.

Illustration . Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill -will towar ds the person whose death is caused. Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation .—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. Illustration . A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted mu rder. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was intended. 102. If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose de ath he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.

Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.

He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. (d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft. (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession, an d A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. (g) A find s a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to misappropri ate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Her e A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.

(l) A tak es an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft. (m) A, being on friendly term s with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent t o use Z’s book. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft. (n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised to g ive away alms. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft. (o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes that property out of Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.

INTRODUCTION Labour law also known as employment law is the body of laws, administrative rulings, and precedents which address the legal rights of, and restrictions on, working people and their organizat ions. As such, it mediates many aspects of the relationship between trade unions, employers and employees. In other words, Labour law defines the rights and obligations as workers, union members and employers in the workplace. Generally, labour law covers :  Industrial relations – certification of unions, labour -management relations, collective bargaining and unfair labour practices;  Workplace health and safety;  Employment standards, including general holidays, annual leave, working hours, unfair dismissals, minimum wage, layoff procedures and severance pay. There are two broad categories of labour law. First, collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between employee, employer and union. Second, individual labour law concerns employees' ri ghts at work and through the contract for work. The labour movement has been instrumental in the enacting of laws protecting labour rights in the 19th and 20th centuries. Labour rights have been integral to the social and economic development since the in dustrial revolution. 1.1.

Labour rights have been integral to the social and economic development since the in dustrial revolution. 1.1. History of Labour laws Labour law arose due to the demands of workers for better conditions, the right to organize, and the simultaneous demands of employers to restrict the powers of workers in many organizations and to keep labour co sts low. Employers' costs can increase due to workers organizing to win higher wages, or by laws imposing costly requirements, such as health and safety or equal opportunities conditions. Workers' organizations, such as trade unions, can also transcend pur ely industrial disputes, and gain political power - which some employers may oppose. The state of labour law at any one time is therefore both the product of, and a component of, struggles between different interests in society. International Labour Organi sation (ILO) was one of the first organisations to deal with labour issues. The ILO was established as an agency of the League of Nations following the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I. Post -war reconstruction and the protection of labour unio ns occupied the attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I. In Great Britain, the Whitley 4 Commission, a subcommittee of the Reconstruction Commission, recommended in its July 1918 Final Report that \"industrial councils\" be establish ed throughout the world. The British Labour Party had issued its own reconstruction programme in the document titled Labour and the New Social Order. In February 1918, the third Inter -Allied Labour and Socialist Conference (representing delegates from Great Britain, France, Belgium and Italy) issued its report, advocating an international labour rights body, an end to secret diplomacy, and other goals. And in December 1918, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) issued its own distinctively apolitical repo rt, which called for the achievement of numerous incremental improvements via the collective bargaining process. As the war drew to a close, two competing visions for the post -war world emerged. The first was offered by the International Federation of Trad e Unions (IFTU), which called for a meeting in Berne in July 1919. The Berne meeting would consider both the future of the IFTU and the various proposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the Cen tral Powers as equals. Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their countries' role in the bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favored a meeting in Paris which would only consider President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as a platform. Despite the American boycott, the Berne meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Berne Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establish ment of socialism. If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

Despite the American boycott, the Berne meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Berne Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establish ment of socialism. If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions. The British proposed establishing an international pa rliament to enact labour laws which each member of the League would be required to implement. Each nation would have two delegates to the parliament, one each from labour and management. An international labour office would collect statistics on labour iss ues and enforce the new international laws. Philosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the internatio nal labour body be authorized only to make recommendations, and that enforcement be left up to the League of Nations. Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the American proposal was adopted. The Americans made 10 proposals. Three were adopted witho ut change: That labour should not be treated as a commodity; that all workers had the right to a wage sufficient to live on; and that women should receive equal pay for equal work. A proposal protecting the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and associati on was amended to include only freedom of association. A proposed ban on the international shipment of goods made by children under the age of 16 was amended to 5 ban goods made by children under the age of 14. A proposal to require an eight -hour work day wa s amended to require the eight -hour work day or the 40 -hour work week (an exception was made for countries where productivity was low). Four other American proposals were rejected. Meanwhile, international delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted: One or more days for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and regular and frequent inspection of factory conditions. The Commission issued its final report on 4 March 1919, and the Peace Conference adopted it without amendment on 11 April. The report became Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. (The Treaty of Versailles was one of the peace treaties at the end of World War I. It ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919.) The fi rst annual conference (referred to as the International Labour Conference, or ILC) began on 29th October 1919 in Washington DC and adopted the first six International Labour Conventions, which dealt with hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age and night work for young persons in industry.

The prominent French socialist Albert Thomas became its first Director General. The ILO became a member of the United Nations system after the demise of the League in 1946. 1.2. Purpose of labour legislation Labour legislation that is adapted to the economic and social challenges of the modern world of work fulfils three crucial roles:  it establishes a legal system that facilitates productive individual and collective emp loyment relationships, and therefore a productive economy;  by providing a framework within which employers, workers and their representatives can interact with regard to work -related issues, it serves as an important vehicle for achieving harmonious indus trial relations based on workplace democracy;  it provides a clear and constant reminder and guarantee of fundamental principles and rights at work which have received broad social acceptance and establishes the processes through which these principles and rights can be implemented and enforced. But experience shows that labour legislation can only fulfills these functions effectively if it is responsive to the conditions on the labour market and the needs of the parties involved. The most efficient way of ensuring that these conditions and needs are taken fully into account is if those concerned are closely involved in the formulation of the legislation through processes of social 6 dialogue. The involvement of stakeholders in this way is of great importance in developing a broad basis of support for labour legislation and in facilitating its application within and beyond the formal structured sectors of the economy. 1.3. Evolution of Labour law in India The law relating to labour and employment is also known as Industrial law in India. The history of labour legislation in India is interwoven with the history of British colonialism. The industrial/labour legislations enacted by the British were primarily intended to protect the interests of the British employers. Considerations of British political economy were naturally paramount in shaping some of these early laws. Thus came the Factories Act. It is well known that Indian textile goods offered stiff competition to British textiles in the export market and hence in order to make India labour costlier the Factories Act was first introduced in 1883 because of the pressure brought on the British parliament by the textile magnates of Manchester and Lancashire. Thus India received the first stipulation of eight hours o f work, the abolition of child labour, and the restriction of women in night employment, and the introduction of overtime wages for work beyond eight hours. While the impact of this measure was clearly welfarist the real motivation was undoubtedly protecti onist.

While the impact of this measure was clearly welfarist the real motivation was undoubtedly protecti onist. The earliest Indian statute to regulate the relationship between employer and his workmen was the Trade Dispute Act, 1929 (Act 7 of 1929). Provisions were made in this Act for restraining the rights of strike and lock out but no machinery was provi ded to take care of disputes. The original colonial legislation underwent substantial modifications in the post -colonial era because independent India called for a clear partnership between labour and capital. The content of this partnership was unanimous ly approved in a tripartite conference in December 1947 in which it was agreed that labour would be given a fair wage and fair working conditions and in return capital would receive the fullest co -operation of labour for uninterrupted production and higher productivity as part of the strategy for national economic development and that all concerned would observe a truce period of three years free from strikes and lockouts. Ultimately the Industrial Disputes Act (the Act) brought into force on 01.04.1947 rep ealing the Trade Disputes Act 1929 has since remained on statute book. 1.4. Constitutional provisions with regard to labour laws The relevance of the dignity of human labour and the need for protecting and safeguarding the interest of labour as human beings has been enshrined in Chapter -III (Articles 16, 19, 23 & 24) and 7 Chapter IV (Articles 39, 41, 42, 43, 43A & 54) of the Constitution of India keeping in line with Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy. Labour is a concurrent subject in t he Constitution of India implying that both the Union and the state governments are competent to legislate on labour matters and administer the same. The bulk of important legislative acts have been enacted by the Parliament. Constitutional Status Union L ist Concurrent List The legislations can be categorized as follows: 1) Labour laws enacted by the Central Government, where the Central Government has the sole responsibility for enforcement. 2) Labour laws enacted by Central Government and enforced both by Central and State Gover nments. 3) Labour laws enacted by Central Government and enforced by the State Governments. 4) Labour laws enacted and enforced by the various State Governments which apply to respective States.

Second, individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work and through the contract for work. The law relating to labour and employment in India is primarily known under the broad category of \"Industrial Law\". The prevailing social and econ omic conditions have been largely influential in shaping the Indian labour legislation, which regulate various aspects of work such as the number of hours of work, wages, social security and facilities provided. 10 The labour laws of independent India derive their origin, inspiration and strength partly from the views expressed by important nationalist leaders during the days of national freedom struggle, partly from the debates of the Constituent Assembly and partly from the provisions of the Constitution an d the International Conventions and Recommendations. The relevance of the dignity of human labour and the need for protecting and safeguarding the interest of labour as human beings has been enshrined in Chapter -III (Articles 16, 19, 23 & 24) and Chapter I V (Articles 39, 41, 42, 43, 43A & 54) of the Constitution of India keeping in line with Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy. The Labour Laws were also influenced by important human rights and the conventions and standards that have emerged from the United Nations. These include right to work of one’s choice, right against discrimination, prohibition of child labour, just and humane conditions of work, social security, protection of wages, redress of grievances, right to organize and form trade unions, collective bargaining and participation in management. The labour laws have also been significantly influenced by the deliberations of the various Sessions of the Indian Labour Conference and the International Labour Conference. Labour l egislations have also been shaped and influenced by the recommendations of the various National Committees and Commissions such as First National Commission on Labour (1969) under the Chairmanship of Justice Gajendragadkar, National Commission on Rural Lab our (1991), Second National Commission on Labour (2002) under the Chairmanship of Shri Ravindra Varma etc. and judicial pronouncements on labour related matters specifically pertaining to minimum wages, bonded labour, child labour, contract labour etc. Under the Constitution of India, Labour is a subject in the concurrent list where both the Central and State Governments are competent to enact legislations. As a result , a large number of labour laws have been enacted catering to different aspects of labou r namely, occupational health, safety, employment, training of apprentices, fixation, review and revision of minimum wages, mode of payment of wages, payment of compensation to workmen who suffer injuries as a result of accidents or causing death or disabl ement, bonded labour, contract labour, women labour and child labour, resolution and adjudication of industrial disputes, provision of social security", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

(Section 7) Legal Position of Apprentices - An apprentice is not a workman during apprentice training. [Section 18] Provisions of labour law like B onus, PF, ESI. Act, gratuity, Industrial Disputes Act etc. are not applicable to him. However, provisions of Factories Act regarding health, safety and welfare will apply to him. Apprentice is also entitled to get compensation from employer for employment injury. [Section 16]. An employer is under no obligation to employ the apprentice after completion of apprenticeship. [Section 22(1)]. However, in UP State Road Transport Corpn v. UP Parivahan Nigam Shishukh Berozgar Sangh AIR 1995 SC 1114 = (1995) 2 SCC 1 , it was held that other things being equal, a trained apprentice should be given preference over direct recruits. It was also held that he need not be sponsored by the employment exchange. Age bar may also be relaxed, to the extent of training period. Th e concerned institute should maintain a list of persons already trained and in between trained apprentices, preference should be given to those who are senior. – same view in UP Rajya Vidyut Parishad v.

Employee State Insurance Act, 1948 Introduction The Employee State Insurance Act, [ESIC] 1948, is a piece of social welfare legislation enacted primarily with the object of providing certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury and also to make provision for certain others matters incidental t hereto. The Act in fact tries to attain the goal of socio -economic justice enshrined in the Directive principles of state policy under part 4 of our constitution, in particular articles 41, 42 and 43 which enjoin the state to make effective provision for s ecuring, the right to work, to education and public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement. The act strives to materialize these avowed objects through only to a limited extent. This act becomes a wider spectrum than factory act.

Generally, shops and establishments employing more than 20 employees are covered by the Act. “ Shop” according to the Delhi Shops and Establishment Act, 1954 means any premises where goods are sold either by 39 retail or wholesale or where services are rendered to customers, and includes an office, a store -room, godown, warehouse or workhouse or work place, whether in the same premises or otherwise, used in or in connection with such trade or business but does not include a factory or a comm ercial establishment. “ Establishment” means a shop, a commercial establishment, residential hotel, restaurant, eating -house, theatre or other places of public amusement or entertainment to which this Act applies and includes such other establishment as Gov ernment may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be an establishment for the purpose of this Act. According to the Delhi Shops and Establishment Act, 1954, “ Commercial Establishment” means any premises wherein any trade, business or profess ion or any work in connection with, or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on and includes a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and charitable or other trust, whether registered or not, which carries on any business, trad e or profession or work in connection with, or incidental", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

According to the Delhi Shops and Establishment Act, 1954, “ Commercial Establishment” means any premises wherein any trade, business or profess ion or any work in connection with, or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on and includes a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and charitable or other trust, whether registered or not, which carries on any business, trad e or profession or work in connection with, or incidental or ancillary thereto, journalistic and printing establishments, contractors and auditors establishments, quarries and mines not governed by the Mines Act, 1952, educational or other institutions run for private gain, and premises in which business of banking, insurance, stocks and shares, brokerage or produce exchange is carried on, but does not include a shop or a factory registered under the Factories Act, 1948, or theatres, cinemas, restaurants, e ating houses, residential hotels, clubs or other places of public amusements or entertainment. Form 01 – Employers’ Registration Form also requires a copy of the registration certificate or licence obtained under the Shops and Establishment Act to be attac hed along with this form. From this it is quite evident that ESI Act will be applicable to shops and establishments. Again the definition of shops and establishment will vary from state to state depending on the shops and establishment act of that particul ar state.  The act does not apply to any member of Indian Naval, Military or Air Forces.  All employees including casual, temporary or contract employees drawing wages less than Rs 10,000 per month are covered. The ceiling limit has been raised from Rs.7500 to Rs.10000 with effect from 01.10.06.  Apprentices covered under the Apprenticeship Act are not covered under this Act. According to Apprenticeship Act 1961, “ apprentice” means a person who is undergoing apprenticeship training in pursuance of a contract of apprenticeship. o The apprentices under any scheme as the name suggests come to learn the tricks of the trade and may not count much so far as the output of the factory is concerned, with that end in view, the apprentices are exempted from the operation o f laws 40 relating to labour unless the State Government thought otherwise. -- Regional Director ESIC v. M/s Arudyog 1987 (1) LLJ 292.  A factory or establishment, to which this Act applies, shall continue to be governed by its provisions even if the number of workers employed falls below the specified limit or the manufacturing process therein ceases to be carried on with the aid of power subsequently.  Where a workman is covered under the ESI scheme, o Compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act cannot be claimed in respect of employment injury. o No benefits can be claimed under the Maternity Benefits Act.

Important Case laws 1. Where by some club not only sporting facilities but a kitchen is also maintained, wherein a big number of members come, it is not ne cessary that they are participating only in sports activities, they are also entertaining themselves and their guests by partaking beverages and tea served by the club. Activity in the kitchen has a direct connection with the activities carried on in the r est of the club premises. It is necessary that the club be registered under ESI Act as regards all the employees engaged by the club irrespective of the fact in which department they are working. Cricket Club of India satisfies the definition of the term `factory' under s. 2(12) of the Act hence covered by it. -- Cricket Club of India v. ESI Corporation 1994 (69) FLR 19. 2. Where in an establishment activities like that of clearing and forwarding is going on, it would fall within the expression \"shop\" even tho ugh clearing of documents is done in customs house meant for export and import of goods. Person involved in such business is catering to the needs of exporters and importers and others wanting to carry the goods further. -- AIR 1993 SC 252 . 3. Anyone having product may approach advertising agency. The advertising agency will prepare an advertising campaign for him utilising the services of the experts it employs in this behalf. It sells the campaign to the client and receives the price thereof. Indubitably, the price will depend upon the nature of the campaign but that does not make any great difference. Essentially, the advertising agency sells its expert services to a client to enable the client to launch an effective campaign of his products without staini ng the language, the premises of an advertising agency can be said to be a \"shop\" --ESI Corporation v. R.K. Swamy 1993 (67) FLR 1145 : 1993 (2) CLR 1068. 4.

The casual employees shall also be brought within it and are entitled to the benefits which the Act grants. The casual labour employed to construct additional buildings for expansion of the factory are the employees under the Act. -- Regional Director, ESIC v. South India Flour Mills Ltd. 1986 (53) FLR 178. 7. Employees engaged for repairs, site clearing, construction of buildings, etc. of the principal employer are employees within the meaning of s. 2(9) of the Act. --Kirloskar Pneumatic Co. Ltd. v. ESI C orporation 1987 (70) FJR 199. 8. The expression \"employed for wages or in connection with the work of a factory or establishment\" is of very wide amplitude and its generality is not in any way prejudiced by the expression and includes any person employed for wages or any work connected with the administration of the factory or establishment or in connection with sale or distribution of the products of the factory or establishments. The word \"includes\" in the statutory definition of a term is generally used to enlarge the meaning of the preceding words and it is by way of extension and not with restriction. In order to determine whether the employees of the company working at its branch sales offices and carrying on acts of sale and distribution of goods manufa ctured by the company as well as the goods produced by the foreign company are \"employees\" what is pertinent is not whether they are \"principally\" and primarily engaged in sale and distribution of the products of the company but whether the business of sal e and distribution either \"principally\" or \"marginally\" of the products of the foreign company is being done on behalf of the company. If the main business of the company itself at the branch sales offices, is to sell and distribute products of foreign com pany and the employees working have been employed by the company basically in connection with this work, it would be difficult to hold that the employees at branch sales offices are not \"employees\" within the meaning of the term defined in s. 2(9) of the A ct notwithstanding the fact that the sale and distribution of the products of the company at 42 such offices are only marginal. -- Director General, ESI Corporation v.

There is no such difference as that of casual or temporary or permanent employee for the expression \"employee\" as defined under s. 2(9) of the Act. It is so wide as to include even a casual employee who is empl oyed just for a day for wages. The test being whether the person is employed for wages on any work which is connected with the work of a factory or establishment which bears the application of the Act except those exempted by the definition. -- ESI Corporat ion v.

On registration every insured person is provided with a ‘tempo rary identification certificate’ which is valid ordinarily for a period of three months but may be extended, if necessary, for a further period of 3 months. Within this period, the insured person is given a permanent ‘family photo identity card’ in exchang e for the certificate. The identity card serves as a means of identification and has to be produced at the time of claiming medical care at the dispensary / clinic and cash benefit at the local office of the corporation. In the event of change of employmen t, it should be produced before the new employer as evidence of registration under the scheme to prevent any duplicate registration. The identity card bears the signature/thumb impression of the insured person.

Calculate the gross profit in the manner specified in - a. First Schedule, in case of a banking company, or b. Second Schedule, in any other case. 2. Calculate the Available Surplus. Avail able Surplus = A+B, where A = Gross Profit – Depreciation admissible u/s 32 of the Income tax Act - Development allowance - Direct taxes payable for the accounting year (calculated as per Sec.7) – Sums specified in the Third Schedule. B = Direct Taxes (cal culated as per Sec. 7) in respect of gross profits for the immediately preceding accounting year – Direct Taxes in respect of such gross profits as reduced by the amount of bonus, for the immediately preceding accounting year. 3. Calculate Allocable Surplus Allocable Surplus = 60% of Available Surplus, 67% in case of foreign companies. 4. Make adjustment for ‘Set -on’ and ‘Set -off’. For calculating the amount of bonus in respect of an accounting year, allocable surplus is computed after considering the amount of s et on and set off from the previous years, as illustrated in Fourth Schedule. 5. The allocable surplus so computed is distributed amongst the employees in proportion to salary or wages received by them during the relevant accounting year.

It can further be classified into (i) Permanent, and (ii) Temporary, Disablement, whether permanent or temporary is said to be total when it incapacitates a worker for all work he was capable of doing at the time of the accident resulting in such disablement.  Total disablement is considered to be permanent if a workman, as a result of an accident, suffers from the injury specified in Part I of Schedule I or suffers from such combination of injuries specified in Part II of Schedule I as would be the loss of earning capacity when totalled to one hundred per cent or more. Disablement is said to be permanent partial when it reduces for all times, the earning capacity of a workman in every employment, which he was capable of undertaking at the time of the accident. Every injury specified in Part II of Schedule I is deemed to result in permanent partial disablement. 94  Temporary disablement reduces the earning capacity of a w orkman in the employment in which he was engaged at the time of the accident. Accident Arising Out Of And In The Course Of Employment An accident arising out of employment implies a casual connection between the injury and the accident and the work done i n the course of employment. Employment should be the distinctive and the proximate cause of the injury. The three tests for determining whether an accident arose out of employment are: 1. At the time of injury workman must have been engaged in the business of the employer and must not be doing something for his personal benefit; 2. That accident occurred at the place where he as performing his duties; and 3. Injury must have resulted from some risk incidental to the duties of the service, or inherent in the nature c ondition of employment. Amount of compensation The amount of compensation payable will be as follows, namely : - (a) where death results an amount equal to fifty per cent of the monthly wages of the deceased workman multiplied by the relevant factor; or an amount of fifty thousand rupees, whichever is more; (b) where permanent total an amount equal to disablement results from sixty the injury per cent of the monthly wages of the injured workman multiplied by the relevant factor, or an amount of sixty thousa nd rupees, whichever is more; For the purposes of clause (a) and clause (b), \"relevant factor\", in relation to a workman means the factor specified in the second column of Schedule IV against the entry in the first column of that Schedule specifying the nu mber of years which are the same as the completed years of the age of the workman on his last birthday immediately preceding the date on", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

An employee is not entitled to get compensation only if ( a) he was drunk or had taken drugs ( b) he wilfully disobeyed orders in respect of safety ( c) he wilfully removed safety guards of machines. However, compensation cannot be denied on the ground that workm an was negligent or careless. – Mar Themotheous v. Santosh Raj 2001 LLR 164 (Ker HC DB). Number of Workmen Employed Is Not Criteria In definition of ‘workman’ in schedule II, in most of the cases, number of workmen employed is not the criteria. In most of cases, employer will be liable even if just one workman is employed. The Act applies to a workshop even if it employs less than 20 workmen and is not a ‘factory’ under Factories Act. – Sunil Industries v. Ram Chander 2000 AIR SCW 4109 = 2001 LLR 64 = 2000 (7) SCALE 415. Payment of compensation only through Commissioner - A Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation is appointed by Government. The compensation must be paid only through the Commissioner in case of death or total disablement. Any lump sum payment to workman under the Act must be made only through Commissioner. Direct payment to workman or his dependents is not recognized at all as compensation. 4k.

MINIMUM WAGES ACT, 1948 The concept of Minimum Wages was first evolved by ILO in 1928 with reference to remu neration of workers in those industries where the, level of wages was substantially low and the labour was vulnerable to exploitation, being not well organised and having less effective bargaining power. The need for a legislation for fixation of minimum w ages in India received boost after World War – II when a draft bill was considered by the Indian Labour Conference in 1945. On the recommendation of the 8th Standing Labour Committee, the Minimum Wages Bill was introduced in the Central Legislative assembl y on 11.4.1946 to provide for fixation of minimum wages in certain employments. The Minimum Wages Bill was passed by the Indian Dominion Legislature and came into force on 15th March, 1948. Under the Act both State and Central Government are “Appropriate Governments” for fixation/revision of minimum rates of wages for employments covered by the Schedule to the Act.

The minimum rates of wages also include Special Allowance (Variable Dearness Allowance) linked to Consumer Price Index Number which are revised twice a year effective from April and October. The rates of wages once fixed are revised at an interval not exceeding of five years. The National Minimum Wage has been considered at various for a in the past. However, State/UT Governments are not unanimous on the need of a National Minimum Wage as socioeconomic conditions vary from state to state, region to region and also from industry to industry due to different geographical, topographical and agro -climatic factors. The Six Regional Minimum Wages Advisor y Committees set up in 1987 to reduce regional disparities among States have been broadened and renamed as Regional Labour Ministers’ Conferences. Employer’s Checklist for Minimum Wages The employer must pay every employee wages as fixed by the Government. (a) Wages must be paid in cash. (b) For the fixation of minimum wages, the employment must have been in Schedule originally or added to the Schedule by a notification under Section 27 of the Act.

This is 93 percent of the workers. The enactment of the Minimum Wages Act in 1948 is a landmark in the labour history of India. The Act provides for fixation of minimum wages for n otified scheduled employment. As per Government of India, for all the States, the minimum wages have been fixed at about Rs 40 to 60 per day per person, average about Rs 50 per day for 25 days per month. There are 45 scheduled employments in the Central sp here and 1232 in the state sphere for which minimum wages have been fixed. To protect the wages against inflation they were linked to rise in the Consumer Price Index. The variable dearness allowance (VDA) came into being in 1991 and the allowance is revis ed twice a year. At present 22 states /Union Territories have these provisions. The states and Union Territories were further directed to ensure that minimum wages are not below Rs 45 per day for any scheduled employment. Fixation of Minimum Wage Rate in India: Minimum rate of the wages fixed or revised consists of the following:  A basic rate of wages and a special allowance, viz., cost of living allowance ;  A basic rate of wages with or without cost of living allowance and cash value of concessions for supplies of essential commodities ;  An all inclusive rate, i.e. basic rate, cost of living allowance and cash value of concessions. 117 The Government may fix the minimum rates of wages either by the hour, by the day, by the month or by such wage period as may be prescribed.

LAWS RELATED TO CHILD LABOUR Background The problem of child labour continues to pose a challenge before the nation. Government has been taking various pro -active measures to tackle this problem. Way back in 1979, Government formed the first committee called Gurupadswamy Committee to study the issue of child labour and to suggest measures to tackle it. The Committee made some far -reaching recommendations. It observed that as long as poverty continu ed, it would be difficult to totally eliminate child labour and 119 hence, any attempt to abolish it through legal recourse would not be a practical proposition. The Committee felt that in the circumstances, the only alternative left was to ban child labour in hazardous areas and to regulate and ameliorate the conditions of work in other areas.", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

The Committee felt that in the circumstances, the only alternative left was to ban child labour in hazardous areas and to regulate and ameliorate the conditions of work in other areas. It recommended that a multiple policy approach was required in dealing with the problems of working children. Based on the recommendations of Gurupadaswamy Committee, t he Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act was enacted in 1986. The Act prohibits employment of children in certain specified hazardous occupations and processes and regulates the working conditions in others. The list of hazardous occupations and pro cesses is progressively being expanded on the recommendation of Child Labour Technical Advisory Committee constituted under the Act. In consonance with the above approach, a National Policy on Child Labour was formulated in 1987. The Policy seeks to adopt a gradual & sequential approach with a focus on rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations & processes in the first instance. The Action Plan outlined in the Policy for tackling this problem is as follows: o Legislative Action Plan for strict enforcement of Child Labour Act and other labour laws to ensure that children are not employed in hazardous employments, and that the working conditions of children working in non -hazardous areas are regulated in accordance with the provisions o f the Child Labour Act. It also entails further identification of additional occupations and processes, which are detrimental to the health and safety of the children. o Focusing of General Developmental Programmes for Benefiting Child Labour - As poverty is the root cause of child labour, the action plan emphasizes the need to cover these children and their families also under various poverty alleviation and employment generation schemes of the Government. o Project Based Plan of Action envis ages starting of projects in areas of high concentration of child labour. Pursuant to this, in 1988, the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme was launched in 9 districts of high child labour endemicity in the country. The Scheme envisages running of special schools for child labour withdrawn from work. In the special schools, these children are provided formal/non -formal education along with vocational training, a stipend of Rs.100 120 per month, supplementary nutrition and regular health check ups so as to prepare them to join regular mainstream schools. Under the Scheme, funds are given to the District Collectors for running special schools for child labour. Most of these schools are run by the NGOs in the district.

The Commission's Mandate is to ensure that all Laws, Policies, Programmes, and Administrative Mechanisms are in consonance with the Child Rights perspective as enshrined in the Constitution of India and also the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Child is defined as a person in the 0 to 18 years age group. The Commission visualises a rights -based perspective flowing into National Policies and Programmes, along with nuanced responses at the State, District and Block levels, taking care of specificities and strengths of each region. In order to touch every chi ld, it seeks a deeper penetration to communities and households and expects that the ground experiences inform the support the field receives from all the authorities at the higher level. Thus the Commission sees an indispensable role for the State, sound institution -building processes, respect for decentralization at the level of the local bodies at the community level and larger societal concern for children and their well -being.

This includes six week s up to and including the day of her delivery and six weeks immediately 134 following that day. If a woman dies during this period, the maternity benefit will be payable only for the days up to and including the day of her death. However, if she delivers a chi ld and dies during the delivery or during the period of six weeks following the delivery, the employer will be liable for the maternity benefits of the entire period of six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery. If the child dies during this period, the liability will be only up to and including the day of the death of the child. In case the woman dies before receiving the benefit, the amount must be paid to her nominee or legal representative. In the event of a miscarriage, the woman must p roduce relevant proof that she has suffered a miscarriage. This will entitle her to receive leave with wages at the rate of the maternity benefit, for a period of six weeks immediately following the date of the miscarriage. Women who are ill on account of pregnancy, delivery, premature birth of a child or a miscarriage are also entitled to a period of absence or to leave with wages at the rate of maternity benefit for a maximum period of one month. However, they must submit proof of their illness. Notice o f claim for maternity benefit A pregnant woman is required to give her employer a notice in writing, stating that the maternity benefit that she is entitled to should be given to her or any person nominated by her and that she will not be working during t he period in which she receives the benefit.

Notice o f claim for maternity benefit A pregnant woman is required to give her employer a notice in writing, stating that the maternity benefit that she is entitled to should be given to her or any person nominated by her and that she will not be working during t he period in which she receives the benefit. This notice should start from the date when she was absent from work, provided that date is not earlier than six weeks from the date of her expected delivery. This notice can also be given soon after the deliver y. On receiving the notice, the employer is bound to permit the woman to absent herself from work until the expiry of six weeks after the delivery. In case a woman fails to give notice, this does not disentitle her from claiming maternity benefit. The emp loyer is still liable to pay her the amount due to her. Dismissal during absence on account of pregnancy When a woman absents herself from work on account of illness during pregnancy, she may not be discharged or dismissed by her employer or issued notice for dismissal. It is equally unlawful for the employer to alter any of the conditions of her service to her disadvantage. If she is discharged or dismissed from service, she should still be entitled to receiving maternity benefit or medical bonus. She ca nnot be deprived of these. 135 The woman can be dismissed only if she is guilty of gross misconduct. In this case, the employer is well within his rights to deprive her of the maternity benefit or medical bonus. A woman who has been deprived of maternity be nefit or medical bonus may, within sixty days from the date on which the order was communicated to her, appeal to the relevant authority. This authority has the final say on whether the woman should or should not be deprived of these benefits. If a woman continues to report to work during the period when she is entitled to maternity benefit, she forfeits her claim to the maternity benefit for the period. However, individual companies may allow the woman to take her leave as late as possible so that she may have more time to nurse the baby later on. Punishment under the Act An employer who violates the provisions of the Maternity Benefits Act can be punishable with imprisonment up to three months or with fine up to five hundred rupees or both. Besides, if t he violation is related to the non -payment of maternity benefit or any other amount, the court can recover this amount as if it is a fine and pay it to the aggrieved person. 5.

LABOUR LAWS IN THE UNORGANIZED SECTOR The unorganized sector can be defined as that part of the work force that have not been able to organize itself in pursuit of a common objective because of certain constraints such as casual nature 148 of employment, ignorance or illiteracy, superior strength of the employer singly or in combination etc. viz. construction workers, labour employed in cottage industry, handloom/power loom workers, sweepers and scavengers, beedi and cigar workers etc. This sector is marked by low incomes, unstable and irregular empl oyment, and lack of protection either from legislation or trade unions. The unorganized sector uses mainly labour intensive and indigenous technology. Out of 440 million workers in India, 93% of the workers are in the unorganized sector. The contribution s made by the unorganized sector to the national income, is very substantial as compared to that of the organized sector. It adds more than 60% to the national income while the contribution of the organised sector is almost half of that depending on the in dustry. Under this category are laws like the Building and Construction Workers Act 1996, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976, The Interstate Migrant Workers Act 1979, The Dock Workers Act 1986, The Plantation Labour Act 1951, The Transport Work ers Act, The Beedi and Cigar Workers Act 1966, The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986, and The Mine Act 1952. Many of the labour and employment laws apply to the unorganized sector also. In India, only about 8% of workers actually get the benefits available under various labour Acts. The rest 92% work in the unorganized sector, and either are not eligible for coverage, or these Acts are just not implemented for them, with the result that these workers have insecure employments and low incom es. They have no coverage of social security, and have to spend out of their meager incomes for all contingencies such as illness and children’s education; in their old age they are helpless. This is so because the Acts as they exist today only apply to t hose workers who have a clear employer -employee relationship. 50% of India’s workers are self employed like small and marginal farmers, artisans and street vendors, many workers work for contractors or have no fixed employer like agricultural labourers and home -based workers and also, employers have been decentralizing, hiring contract labour and divesting themselves of", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

Second, workers are not organized and hence have no bargaining pow er, because of this, even when laws exist workers are too weak, too disorganized to demand them. Third, no social security system has been devised which would meet the needs of these workers. For example, many of these workers are migratory; others have no fixed income, and could pay at certain times but not at others. Fourth, the laws are supposed to be implemented through the 149 Government bureaucracy which has neither the manpower nor the knowhow to reach the scattered crores of workers. Purpose of the Uno rganized Workers’ Social Security Act of 2008 This Act builds a social security system for the unorganized workers. It does the following: 1. It redefines worker so as to include all types of workers, not only those who have a fixed employer. In so doing, it brings in all the self employed workers as well as casual, contract, home based etc. 2. It identifies each worker and gives him/her a unique social security number and social security card. 3. It offers a variety of social security benefits to the unorg anized worker. These would include health insurance, maternity benefit and pensions. As these schemes become successful, the trust and participation of workers’ builds up, and more funds come in, a variety of different benefits can be included such as chil dren’s education, housing, skill building etc. 4. It binds the Central Government to providing a minimum amount of benefits and funds. 5. It creates a structure, an architecture that works with but does not rely solely on the Government system. It creates a participatory structure that builds on already existing civil society, government and semi -government organizations which have a good record. 6. It encourages the unorganized workers to organize around the social security structures and benefits, creati ng a voice and space for them.

WOMEN LABOUR AND THE LAW Wom en are known to work on farms, in road and housing construction, and of late, in factories manufacturing garments and electronic assembly plants. Skilled women workers also have been working in traditional village industries either as self employed or as p aid workers. In hill areas, search for forest products including fuel wood engages a fairly large number of women. The majority 152 of women work in the unorganized sector for low wages and at low levels of skills. The number of women workers during the last f our decades has more than doubled from 40 million to 90 million. Women constitute a significant part of the workforce in India but they lag behind men in terms of work participation and quality of employment. According to Government sources, out of 407 mil lion total workforce, 90 million are women workers, largely employed (about 87 percent) in the agricultural sector as labourers and cultivators. Employment opportunities and wage disparity In India, as in many developing countries, gender inequality per sists in terms of women participation in labour force, lower wages and salaries of women and access to resources. The percentage share of female population in total population in India is around 48%, while the work participation rate of females is only 26% as compared to 52% in males. About 24.9% of women in rural areas and about 14.8% of women in urban areas were in the workforce in India during 2004 -05 (UNCTAD report). In urban areas, on an average wage/salary paid to females is only 75% of that paid to m ales, while in rural areas females are paid 58% of what is paid to the males. This wage disparity differs across sectors and education levels. Applicability of Labour laws for women In addition to the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 almost all the major centr al labour laws are applicable to women workers. The Equal Remuneration Act was passed in 1976, providing for the payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for same or similar nature of work. Under this law, no discrimination is permissible in recruitment and service conditions except where employment of women is prohibited or restricted by the law.

The Equal Remuneration Act was passed in 1976, providing for the payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for same or similar nature of work. Under this law, no discrimination is permissible in recruitment and service conditions except where employment of women is prohibited or restricted by the law. The situation regarding enforcement of the provisions of this law is regularly monitored by the Central Ministry of Labour and the Central Advisory Committee. In respect of occupational hazards concerning the safety of women at workplaces, in 1997 the Supreme Court of India in the case of Vishakha Vs. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 SCC 241] held that sexual harassment of working women amounts to violati on of rights of gender equality. As a logical consequence it also amounts to violation of the right to practice any profession, occupation, and trade. The judgment also laid down the definition of sexual harassment, the preventive steps, the complaint mech anism, and the need for creating awareness of the rights of women workers. Implementation of these guidelines has already begun by employers by amending the rules under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. The Factories Act, 1948 has the following provisions of interest to women (Sections 19, 22(2), 27, 42(1)(b), 48, 66, 79(1) and 114.): 153 a. The Act prohibits women from being employed in cleaning; lubricating or adjusting certain machinery when it is in motion, if that would expose them to ris k of injury. Women are also not allowed to work in the part of a factory where a cotton -opener is at work unless certain conditions are met. b. Suitable sanitation facilities must be provided. c. If more than 30 women are employed, the employer must provide a free crèche on the premises for children under six years of age. State governments may make rules governing these crèches, which may include requirements to provide clothes washing and changing facilities, child -feeding facilities and free milk and refresh ments for the children. d. Women cannot be exempted from the requirement that the maximum working day for adults is 9 hours, and cannot work in factories between the hours of 6am and 7 pm (unless the factory falls within a specific exemption, but in any case , not between the hours or 10 pm and 5 am.). In relation to women, there must not be a change of shifts except after a weekly or other holiday. However, the State governments can change these requirements in the fish curing and canning industries. e. Periods of absence on maternity leave are included in calculating periods of service for the purposes of annual leave.

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS Concept of Industrial Relations The term ‘Industrial Relations’ comprises of two terms: ‘Industry’ and ‘Relat ions’. “Industry” refers to “any productive activity in which an individual (or a group of individuals) is (are) engaged”. By “relations” we mean “the relationships that exist within the industry between the employer and his workmen.” The term industrial relations explain the relationship between employees and management which stem directly or indirectly from union -employer relationship. Industrial relations are the relationships between employees and employers within the organizational settings. The fiel d of industrial relations looks at the relationship between management and workers, particularly groups of workers represented by a union. Industrial relations are basically the interactions between employers, employees and the government, and the institut ions and associations through which such interactions are mediated. The term industrial relations have a broad as well as a narrow outlook. Originally, industrial relations were broadly defined to include the relationships and interactions between employer s and employees. From this perspective, industrial relations cover all aspects of the employment relationship, including human resource management, employee relations, and union -management (or labour) relations. Now its meaning has become more specific and restricted. Accordingly, industrial relations pertains to the study and practice of collective bargaining, trade unionism, and labour -management relations, while human resource management is a separate, largely distinct field that deals with non -union emp loyment relationships and the personnel practices and policies of employers. The relationships which arise at and out of the workplace generally include the relationships between individual workers, the relationships between workers and their employer, the relationships between employers, the relationships employers and workers have with the organizations formed to promote their respective interests, and the relations between those organizations, at all levels. Industrial relations also includes the process es through which these relationships are expressed (such as, collective bargaining, workers’ participation in decision -making, and grievance and dispute settlement), and the management of conflict between employers, workers and trade unions, when it arises .

The relationship between Employer and employee or trade unions is called Industrial Relation. Harmonious relationship is necessary for both employers and employees to safeguard the interests of the both the parties of the production. In order to maintai n good relationship with the employees, the main functions of every organization should avoid any dispute with them or settle it as early as possible so as to ensure industrial peace and higher productivity. Personnel management is mainly concerned with th e human relation in industry because the main theme of personnel management is to get the work done by the human 158 power and it fails in its objectives if good industrial relation is maintained. In other words good Industrial Relation means industrial peace which is necessary for better and higher productions. Definition of Industrial Relations 1. Industrial Relation is that part of management which is concerned with the manpower of the enterprise – whether machine operator, skilled worker or manager. BETHEL, S MITH & GROUP 2. Industrial Relation is a relation between employer and employees, employees and employees and employees and trade unions. - Industrial dispute Act 1947 3. While moving from jungle of the definitions, here, Industrial Relation is viewed as the “process by which people and their organizations interact at the place of work to establish the terms and conditions of employment.” The Industrial Relation relations is also called as labour - management, employee -employers relations. Labour relations can ta ke place on many levels, such as the \"shop -floor\", the regional level, and the national level. The distribution of power amongst these levels can greatly shape the way an economy functions. Governments set the framework for labour relations through legisla tion and regulation. Industrial relations has become one of the most delicate and complex problems of modern industrial society. Industrial progress is impossible without cooperation of labours and harmonious relationships. Therefore, it is in the interest of all to create and maintain good relations between employees (labour) and employers (management). A few notable features pertaining to Industrial Relations are as under: 1. Industrial Relation does not emerge in vacuum they are born of employment relation ship in an industrial setting. Without the existence of the two parties, i.e. labour and management, this relationship cannot exist. It is the industry, which provides the environment for industrial relations. 2.

So the focus of Industrial Relations in on the study of the 159 attitudes, relationships, practices and procedure developed by the contending parties to resolve or at least minimize confl icts. 3. As the labour and management do not operate in isolations but are parts of large system, so the study of Industrial Relation also includes vital environment issues like technology of the workplace, country’s socio -economic and political environment, nation’s labour policy, attitude of trade unions workers and employers. 4. Industrial Relation also involve the study of conditions conductive to the labour, management’s co -operations as well as the practices and procedures required to elicit the desired co -operation from both the parties. 5. Industrial Relations also study the laws, rules regulations agreements, awards of courts, customs and traditions, as well as policy framework lay down by the governments for eliciting co -operations between labour and manage ment. Besides this, it makes an in - depth analysis of the interference patterns of the executive and judiciary in the regulations of labour –managements relations. In fact the concepts of Industrial Relations are very broad -based, drawing heavily from a vari ety of discipline like social sciences, humanities, behavioural sciences, laws etc. Industrial Relation encompasses all such factors that influence behaviour of people at work. A few such important factors are details below: 1. Institution: It includes gov ernment, employers, trade unions, unions’ federations or associations, government bodies, labour courts, tribunals and other organizations which have direct or indirect impact on the industrial relations systems. 2. Characters : It aims to study the role o f workers unions and employers’ federations officials, shop stewards, industrial relations officers/ manager, mediator/conciliators / arbitrator, judges of labour court, tribunal etc. 3.

The main aspect of Industrial Relations are: - 1. Labour Relations, i.e. relations between union and management. 161 2. Employer -employees relations, i.e. relations between management and employees. 3. Group relations, i.e. relations between various groups of workme n. 4. Community or Public relations, i.e. relations between industry and society. 5. Promotions and development of healthy labour -managements relations. 6. Maintenance of industrial peace and avoidance of industrial strife 7. Development of true industrial Democracy. Effects of poor Industrial Relations Poor Industrial Relation produces highly disquieting effects on the economic life of the country. We may enumerate the ill -effects of poor Industrial Relations as under: 1. Multiplier effects: Modern industry and for that matter modern economy are interdependent. Hence although the direct loss caused due to industrial conflict in any one plant may not be very great, the total loss caused due to its multipliers effect on the total economy is always very great. 2. Fall in norma l tempo: poor Industrial Relations adversely affect the normal tempo of work so that work far below the optimum level. Costs build up. Absenteeism and labour turnover increase.

Methods have to be improved. Economics have to be introduced. New products have to be designed, produced and put in the market. Each of these tasks involve s a whole chain of changes and this is resisted bitterly if these are industrial conflict. 4. Frustration and social cost: every man comes to the work place not only to earn a living. He wants to satisfy his social and egoistic needs also. When he finds diffi culty in satisfying these needs he feels frustrated. Poor Industrial Relations take a heavy toll in terms of human frustration. They reduce cordiality and aggravate social tension. Suggestions to Improve Industrial Relation: - 162 1. Both management and unions sho uld develop constructive attitudes towards each other 2. All basic policies and procedures relating to Industrial Relation should be clear to everybody in the organization and to the union leader. The personnel manager must make certain that line people will understand and agree with these policies. 3. The personnel manager should remove any distrust by convincing the union of the company’s integrity and his own sincerity and honesty. Suspicious, rumours and doubts should all be put to rest. 4. The personnel manager should not vie with the union to gain workers‘ loyal to both the organization. Several research studies also confirm the idea of dual allegiance. There is strong evidence to discard the belief that one can owe allegiance to one group only. 5. Management shou ld encourage right kind of union leadership. While it is not for the management to interfere with union activities, or choose the union leadership, its action and attitude will go a long way towards developing the right kind of union leadership. IMPORTANC E OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS: The healthy industrial relations are a key to the progress. Their significance may be discussed as under - 1. Uninterrupted production – The most important benefit of industrial relations is that this ensures continuity of productio n. This means, continuous employment for all from manager to workers. The resources are fully utilized, resulting in the maximum possible production. There is uninterrupted flow of income for all. Smooth running of an industry is of vital importance for se veral other industries; to other industries if the products are intermediaries or inputs; to exporters if these are export goods; to consumers and workers, if these are goods of mass consumption. 2.

Reduction in Industrial Disputes – Good industrial relation reduces the industrial disputes. Disputes are reflections of the failure of basic human urges or motivations to secure adequate satisfaction or expression which are fully cured by good industrial relations. Strikes, lockouts, go -slow tactics, gherao and gr ievances are some of the reflections of industrial unrest which do not spring up in an atmosphere of industrial peace. It helps promoting co -operation and increasing production. 163 3. High morale – Good industrial relations improve the morale of the employees. Employees work with great zeal with the feeling in mind that the interest of employer and employees is one and the same, i.e. to increase production. Every worker feels that he is a co -owner of the gains of industry. The employer in his turn must realize th at the gains of industry are not for him along but they should be shared equally and generously with his workers. In other words, complete unity of thought and action is the main achievement of industrial peace. It increases the place of workers in the society and their ego is satisfied. It naturally affects production because mighty co - operative efforts alone can produce great results. 4. Mental Revolution – The main object of industrial relation is a complete mental revolution of workers and employees. The i ndustrial peace lies ultimately in a transformed outlook on the part of both. It is the business of leadership in the ranks of workers, employees and Government to work out a new relationship in consonance with a spirit of true democracy. Both should think themselves as partners of the industry and the role of workers in such a partnership should be recognized. On the other hand, workers must recognize employer’s authority. It will naturally have impact on production because they recognize the interest of e ach other. 5. New Programmes – New programmes for workers development are introduced in an atmosphere of peace such as training facilities, labour welfare facilities etc. It increases the efficiency of workers resulting in higher and better production at lowe r costs. 6. Reduced Wastage – Good industrial relations are maintained on the basis of cooperation and recognition of each other. It will help increase production.

If the twin objectives of rapid national development and increased social justice are to be achieved, there must be harmonious relationship between management and labour. Difference between industrial relations and human relations The term “Industrial Relations” is different from “Human Relations”. Industrial relations refer to the relations between the employees and the employer in an industry. Human relations refer to a personnel -management policy to be adopted in industrial organiza tions to develop a sense of belongingness in the workers improves their efficiency and treat them as human beings and make a partner in industry. Industrial relations cover the matters regulated by law or by collective agreement between employees and emplo yers. On the other hand, problems of human relations are personal in character and are related to the behavior of worker where morale and social elements predominated. Human relations approach is personnel philosophy which can be applied by the management of an undertaking. The problem of industrial relations is usually dealt with a three levels – the level of undertaking, the industry and at the national level. To sum up the term “Industrial Relations” is more wide and comprehensive and the term “Human Rel ations” is a part of it. Determining factors of industrial relations – Good industrial relations depend on a great variety of factors. Some of the more obvious ones are listed below: 1. History of industrial relations – No enterprise can escape its good and bad history of industrial relations. A good history is marked by harmonious relationship between management and workers. A bad history by contrast is characterized by militant strikes and lockouts. Both types of history have a tendency to perpetuate themse lves. Once militancy is established as a mode of operations there is a tendency for militancy to continue. Or once harmonious relationship is established there is a tendency for harmony to continue. 2. Economic satisfaction of workers – Psychologists recogniz e that human needs have a certain priority. Need number one is the basic survival need. Much of men conducted are dominated by this need. Man works because he wants to survive. This is all the more for underdeveloped countries where workers are still livin g under subsistence 165 conditions. Hence economic satisfaction of workers is another important prerequisite for good industrial relations. 3.

Hence economic satisfaction of workers is another important prerequisite for good industrial relations. 3. Social and Psychological satisfaction – Identifying the social and psychological urges of workers is a very important st ep in the direction of building good industrial relations. A man does not live by bread alone. He has several other needs besides his physical needs which should also be given due attention by the employer. An organization is a joint venture involving a cl imate of human and social relationships wherein each participant feels that he is fulfilling his needs and contributing to the needs of others. This supportive climate requires economic rewards as well as social and psychological rewards such as workers’ p articipation in management, job enrichment, suggestion schemes, re -dressal of grievances etc. 4. Off-the-Job Conditions – An employer employs a whole person rather than certain separate characteristics. A person’s traits are all part of one system making up a whole man. His home life is not separable from his work life and his emotional condition is not separate from his physical condition. Hence for good industrial relations it is not enough that the worker’s factory life alone should be taken care of his off -the-job conditions should also be improved to make the industrial relations better. 5. Enlightened Trade Unions – The most important condition necessary for good industrial relations is a strong and enlightened labour movement which may help to promote the status of labour without harming the interests of management, Unions should talk of employee contribution and responsibility. Unions should exhort workers to produce more, persuade management to pay more, mobilize public opinion on vital labour issues and h elp Government to enact progressive labour laws. 6. Negotiating skills and attitudes of management and workers – Both management and workers’ representation in the area of industrial relations come from a great variety of backgrounds in terms of training, edu cation, experience and attitudes. These varying backgrounds play a major role in shaping the character of industrial relations. Generally speaking, well -trained and experienced negotiators who are motivated by a desire for industrial peace create a bargain ing atmosphere conducive to the writing of a just and equitable collective agreement. On the other hand, ignorant, inexperienced and ill - trained persons fail because they do not recognize that collective bargaining is a difficult human activity which deals as much in the emotions of people as in their economic 166 interests. It requires careful preparation and top –notch executive competence. It is not usually accomplished by some easy trick or gimmick. Parties must have trust and confidence in each other.

They must possess empathy, i.e. they should be able to perceive a problem from the opposite angle with an open mind. They should put themselves in the shoes of the other party and then diagnose the problem. Other factors which help to create mutual trust are r espect for the law and breadth of the vision. Both parties should show full respect for legal and voluntary obligations and should avoid the tendency to make a mountain of a mole hill. 7. Public policy and legislation: - when Government, regulates employee re lations, it becomes a third major force determining industrial relations the first two being the employer and the union. Human behaviour is then further complicated as all three forces interact in a single employee relation situation. Nonetheless, governme nt in all countries intervenes in management – union relationship by enforcing labour laws and by insisting that the goals of whole society shall take precedence over those of either of the parties. Government intervention helps in three different ways 1) it helps in catching and solving problems before they become serious. Almost everyone agrees that it is better to prevent fires them to try stopping them after they start; 2) It provides a formalized means to the workers and employers to give emotional rel ease to their dissatisfaction; and 3) It acts as a check and balance upon arbitrary and capricious management action. 8. Better education: - with rising skills and education workers’ expectations in respect of rewards increase. It is a common knowledge that t he industrial worker in India is generally illiterate and is misled by outside trade union leaders who have their own axe to grind. Better workers’ education can be a solution to this problem. This alone can provide worker with a proper sense of responsibi lity, which they owe to the organization in particular, and to the community in general. 9. Nature of industry: - In those industries where the costs constitute a major proportion of the total cast, lowering down the labour costs become important when the pro duct is not a necessity and therefore, there is a little possibility to pass additional costs on to consumer. Such periods, level of employment and wages rise in decline in employment and wages. This makes workers unhappy and destroys good industrial relat ions.

Industrial Relations Programme 167 Today’s professional industrial relations director, or by whatever title he is designated, no longer views his job as personalizing management, or that of a social worker in a factory, or a union buster, he looks upon h is department as an adjunct to management supervision at all levels; he keeps other executives informed about new discoveries, programme trends and needs. At the same time, he provides efficient service in the operation of several centralized services. A successful industrial relations programme reflects the personnel viewpoint, which is influenced by three main considerations: a) Individual thinking b) Policy awareness and c) Expected group reaction Individualized thinking makes if imperative for the admin istrator to consider the entire situation in which the affected individual is placed. Policy awareness underscores the idea of the consistency of treatment and the precedent value of any decision which a management takes; while expected group reaction bala nces what we know of human nature in groups against an individual’s situation in the light of the policy that has been formulated and implemented. In all these different circumstances, reality demands that all the three aspects of the personnel viewpoint s hould be considered at once in terms of the past, the present and the future. This viewpoint is held at all the levels of management from the top to the bottom, from the top executives and staff to the line and supervisory personnel. Scope of industrial re lations work The staff employed in the industrial relations department should know the limitations within which it has to function. The industrial relations director generally has several assistants who help him to perform his functions effectively, and he usually reports directly to the president or chairman of the board of directors of an organization. The functions of the industrial relations staff are - 1. Administration, including overall organization, supervision and co -ordination of industrial relations policies and programmes. 2. Liaison with outside groups and personnel departments as well as with various cadres of the management staff. 168 3. Drafting of regulations, rules, laws or orders and their construction and interpretation. 4. Position classification, inclu ding overall direction of job analysis, salary and wage administration, wage survey and pay schedules. 5. Recruitment and employment of workers and other staff. 6. Employment testing, including intelligence tests, mechanical aptitude tests and achievement tests. 7. Placement, including induction and assignment. 8. Training of apprentices, production workers, foremen and executives. 9. Employee counselling on all types of personnel problems -educational, vocational, health or behaviour problems. 10. Medical and health services. 11. Safety services, including first aid training. 12. Group activities, including group health insurance, housing, cafeteria programmes and social clubs. 13.

Functional Requirements of A Successful Industrial Relations Programme The basic requirements on which a successful industrial relations programme is based are: - 169 1. Top Management Support: - Since industrial relations is a functional staff service, it must necessarily derive its authority from the line organization. This is ensured by providing that the industrial relations director should report to a top line authority to the president, chairman or vice president of an organization. 2. Sound Personnel Policies: - These constitute the business philosophy of an organization and guide it in arriving at its human relations decisions. The purpose of such policies is to decide, before any emergency arises, w hat shall be done about the large number of problems which crop up every day during the working of an organization. Policies can be successful only when they are followed at all the level of an enterprise, from top to bottom. 3. Adequate Practices should be d eveloped by professionals: - In the field to assist in the implementation of the policies of an organization. A system of procedures is essential if intention is to be properly translated into action. The procedures and practices of an industrial relations department are the “tool of management” which enables a supervisor to keep ahead of his job that of the time -keeper, rate adjuster, grievance reporter and merit rater. 4. Detailed Supervisory Training : - To ensure the organizational policies and practices ar e properly implemented and carried into effect by the industrial relations staff, job supervisors should be trained thoroughly, so that they may convey to the employees the significance of those policies and practices. They should, moreover, be trained in leadership and in communications. 5. Follow -up of Results: - A constant review of an industrial relations programme is essential, so that existing practices may be properly evaluated and a check may be exercised on certain undesirable tendencies, should they manifest themselves. A follow up of turnover, absenteeism, departmental morale, employee grievances and suggestion; wage administration, etc. should be supplemented by continuous research to ensure that the policies that have been pursued are best fitted t o company needs and employee satisfaction. Hints of problem areas may be found in exit interviews, in trade union demands and in management meetings, as well as in formal social sciences research.

Hints of problem areas may be found in exit interviews, in trade union demands and in management meetings, as well as in formal social sciences research. Perspective theories When studying the theories of industr ial relations, there are three major perspectives that contrast in their approach to the nature of workplace relations. The three views are generally described as the unitary, pluralist and Marxist perspectives. The Marxist perspective is sometimes referre d to as the Conflict Model. Each offers a particular perception of workplace relations and will therefore 170 interpret such events as workplace conflict, the role of trade unions and job regulation varies differently. 1. Unitary perspective In Unitarianism, the organization is perceived as an integrated and harmonious whole with the ideal of \"one happy family\", where management and other members of the staff all share a common purpose, emphasizing mutual cooperation. Furthermore, unitarism has a paternalistic app roach where it demands loyalty of all employees, being predominantly managerial in its emphasis and application. Consequently, trade unions are deemed as unnecessary since the loyalty between employees and organizations are considered mutually exclusive, w here there can't be two sides of industry. Conflict is perceived as disruptive and the pathological result of agitators, interpersonal friction and communication breakdown. 2. Pluralistic perspective In pluralism the organization is perceived as being made up of powerful and divergent sub -groups, each with its own legitimate loyalties and with their own set of objectives and leaders. In particular, the two predominant sub -groups in the pluralistic perspective are the management and trade unions. Consequently, the role of management would lean less towards enforcing and controlling and more toward persuasion and co -ordination. Trade unions are deemed as legitimate representatives of employees; conflict is dealt by collective bargaining and is viewed not necessar ily as a bad thing and, if managed, could in fact be channelled towards evolution and positive change. 3. Marxist/Radical Perspective This view of industrial relations looks at the nature of the capitalist society, where there is a fundamental division of int erest between capital and labour, and sees workplace relations against this history. This perspective sees inequalities of power and economic wealth as having their roots in the nature of the capitalist economic system. Conflict is therefore seen as inevit able and trade unions are a natural response of workers to their exploitation by capital. Whilst there may be periods of acquiescence, the Marxist view would be that institutions of joint regulation would enhance rather than limit management's position as they presume the continuation of capitalism rather than challenge it. There are two variants of this view - the pessimist view propounded by Lenin, Trotsky and Michel and the optimist view propounded by Marx and Engels.", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

These labour laws were protective in nature and covered a wide range of aspects of workplace industrial relations like laws on health and safety of labours, layoffs and retrenchment policies, industrial disputes and the like. The basic purpose of these laws was to protect labours. However, these protectionist policies created an atmosphere that led to increased inefficiency in fi rms, over employment and inability to introduce efficacy. With the coming of globalization, the 40 year old policy of protectionism proved inadequate for Indian industry to remain competitive as the lack of flexibility posed a serious threat to manufacture rs because they had to compete in the international market. With the advent of liberalization in 1992, the industrial relations policy began to change. Now, the policy was tilted towards employers. Employers opted for workforce reduction, introduced polici es of voluntary retirement schemes and flexibility in workplace also increased. Thus, globalization brought major changes in industrial relations policy in India. The changes can be summarized as follows: 1. Collective bargaining in India has mostly been dec entralized, but now in sectors where it was not so, are also facing pressures to follow decentralization. 2. Some industries are cutting employment to a significant extent to cope with the domestic and foreign competition e.g. pharmaceuticals. On the other ha nd, in other industries where the demand for employment is increasing are experiencing employment growths. 3. In the expansionary economy there is a clear shortage of managers and skilled labour. 4. The number of local and enterprise level unions has increased and there is a significant reduction in the influence of the unions. 5. Under pressure some unions and federations are putting up a united front e.g. banking. 6. Another trend is that the employers have started to push for internal unions i.e. no outside affilia tion. 7. HR policies and forms of work are emerging that include, especially in multi -national companies, multi -skills, variable compensation, job rotation etc. These new policies are difficult to implement in place of old practices as the institutional set u p still needs to be changed. 8. HRM is seen as a key component of business strategy. 9. Training and skill development is also receiving attention in a number of industries, especially banking and information technology. 172 10.

SPECIAL POINTS TO BE NOTED WHILE DRAFTI NG EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT Employment Agreement Employment agreement is an agreement that is entered into between two parties, i.e. the employer and employee. It is a document that pacifies the responsibilities and duties expected of an employee. It also desc ribed the profile of the job and the title. The document ensures that the employee knows his place in the organisation and what is expected of him. Employment agreements should be created in a way that is just and fair for all the employees. If this is fol lowed, employees will do their tasks and responsibilities well and without any negative emotions toward their employers. Usually employment contracts contain only vague references to the \"policies and procedures to which the employee will be bound\". The em ployer should provide the employee with all of the company policies and other documents that relate to the contract or are referred to in the contract. Following are the usual contents of an employment agreement: 1) Name of the parties involved 2) Starting date of employment 3) Title and description of the job 4) Location of work 5) Hours of work 6) Probationary period 7) Salary 8) Restrictive terms 9) Holidays 10) Other information like deductions, permissible expenses, notice period etc. The employment agreement may be beneficial for both parties because they will know what responsibilities they are getting in to. On the part of the employees, they are assured that they will be able to get compensation as an exchange for the work they rendered. Employees will also be clearly informed about the things that employers are expecting them to do. On the part of the employers, they are assured that their employees are well informed of the things that they should do, as well as their obligations for the company. Through employment agreement, e mployers will not be left immediately by their employees without providing them enough time to seek for someone who will take the latter’s place. 173 The benefits of an employment agreement are enumerated below:  Employment agreement is useful because it has c ontrol over the employee’s capability to leave. An employer will be given more time to find a replacement for the employee.  If the employee is given confidential information about the business, certain confidentiality clauses can also be included in the ag reement. The employer may forbid the employee from using or disclosing the information he/she acquired for personal gain.  Employers can also use the employment agreement in enticing skilled individuals to work for them.

Non -Disclosure Agreement / Contract of Confidentiality A non -disclosure agre ement is a legal agreement between two parties where the company gives access to certain restricted information to the employee preventing its disclosure by the employee to third parties. The secrecy of the restricted information is protected through the n on-disclosure agreement or the confidentiality agreement. If the classified information is transferred to the employee orally he must provide in writing that the information so communicated constitutes confidential information to which he is legally bound. Confidential information constitutes the essence of every business. Disclosure of such information may be potentially damaging to a company and provide an unfair advantage to its competitors. Protection of confidential information, therefore, assumes trem endous importance. In the business world, confidential information includes information that qualifies as a trade or business secret. A 176 trade secret is defined as any information that is not known outside the company and which is not readily ascertainable by proper means, thereby giving the company an advantage over its competitors. Whether any information is a trade secret depends on a variety of factors, such as the extent to which the information is known outside of the company’s business; the extent to which the information is known by employees and others involved in the company’s business; the measures taken by the company to guard the secrecy of the information; the value of the information to the company and to its competitors; the", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

Whether any information is a trade secret depends on a variety of factors, such as the extent to which the information is known outside of the company’s business; the extent to which the information is known by employees and others involved in the company’s business; the measures taken by the company to guard the secrecy of the information; the value of the information to the company and to its competitors; the money or effort ex pended in developing the information; and the ease with which the information can be duplicated by others. Examples of trade secrets include methods of production not protected by patent, testing procedures, processes, designs, formulas and software. If it is found that the employee is likely to misuse confidential information obtained while in employment, the employer is entitled to an injunction preventing such misuse. However, an injunction cannot be granted to protect the employer for misuse that has a lready taken place. For such past misuse, the employer is entitled only to damages; as otherwise, this will go against fair competition. The injunction should not give a competitive advantage to the employer, as for example no injunction should be granted if an employee obtains the information independently from the market. Additional remedies include an award of damages for loss of profit because of diminution in the employer’s business or damage to the employer’s goodwill. However, these are not granted i n the absence of detailed evidence to that effect. The following steps can be taken by employers to protect confidential information: i. Companies should ensure that before disclosing confidential information to employees, a non-disclosure agreement is in pl ace. ii. Companies should ensure that the confidential nature of the information is expressly communicated to the employees before disclosure. iii. Companies should restrict the number of employees having access to confidential information at any point of time. iv. Companies should mark files and relevant documents as confidential. v. Companies should have in place proper security systems for computers and networks. Passwords should be provided and changed frequently. vi. Companies should have in place proper policies for document retention and destruction. vii. Companies should very clearly set forth the standards of non -disclosure of confidential information in the employee handbook. 177 viii. Companies should take special care when an employee is leaving the company. The employee sh ould be reminded of his obligations and asked to deposit all confidential material in his possession. ix. A covenant of non -disclosure should also include a clause whereby the employee is under an obligation to disclose to the employer any confidential inform ation acquired in the course of employment, which is in the nature of a trade secret for the company but unknown to the employer. 11.

International Labour Organization The International Labour Organization (ILO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that deals with labour issues. Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. Its secretaria t — the people who are employed by it throughout the world is known as the International Labour Office. The ILO was established as an agency of the League of Nations following the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I. Post -war reconstruction and t he protection of labour unions occupied the attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I. The first annual conference (referred to as the International Labour Conference, or ILC) began on 29 October 1919 in Washington DC and adopted t he first six International Labour Conventions, which dealt with hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity 180 protection, night work for women, minimum age and night work for young persons in industry. The prominent French socialist Albert Thomas beca me its first Director General. The ILO became a member of the United Nations system after the demise of the League in 1946. Its constitution, as amended, includes the Declaration of Philadelphia (1944) on the aims and purposes of the organisation. As of Ap ril 2009 , the current director -general is Juan Soma via (since 1999). Unlike other United Nations specialized agencies, the International Labour Organization has a tripartite governing structure — representing governments, employers and workers. Presently there are 181 members. The International Labour Orga nization (ILO) is devoted to advancing opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. Its main aims are to promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities , enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue in handling work -related issues. In promoting social justice and internationally recognized human and labour rights, the organization continues to pursue its founding mission that labour peace is essentia l to prosperity. Today, the ILO helps advance the creation of decent jobs and the kinds of economic and working conditions that give working people and business people a stake in lasting peace, prosperity and progress. The Governing Body is the executive of the International Labour Office. It meets three times a year, in March, June and November.

The Governing Body is composed of 28 government representatives, 14 workers' group representatives, and 14 employers' group representatives. Ten of the government seats are held permanently by Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The remaining government representatives are elected by government delegates every three years. 13. Important authorities under the Labour law in I ndia 1.

Labour Courts / Industrial Tribunals Most of the labour disputes are referred to the Labour Courts/Industrial Tribunals through the Department of Labour under the respective State Government. The process for labour dispute starts with filing of a petition before Labour Conciliation Officer and in case no compromise is possible, the said officer sends a failure report to the Government. After consideration of the said report, the Government may send a reference to the Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal. In certain matters, the labour dispute can be directly filed in the court concerned . Labour Courts These courts are found in every district and they form the courts of original jurisdiction under which various labour laws and rules are enforced. Appellate Labour Courts These courts hear only the Appeals and revisions originating from the judgements and orders of the subordinate original labour courts and officers, under the provisions of various labour and related laws. a) When an industrial dispute has been referred to a Labour Court for adjudication, it is the duty of the Labour Court to (i) Hold proceedings expeditiously, and (ii) To submit its award to the appropriate", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

LABOUR LEGISLATIONS ACROSS THE WORLD 1. Australia Australian labour law has had a unique development that distinguishes it from other English speaking jurisdictions. In 1904 the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed mandati ng \"Conciliation and Arbitration for the Prevention and Settlement of Industrial Disputes extending beyond the Limits of any one State\". In 2005, the WorkChoices Act removed unfair dismissal laws, removed the \"no disadvantage test\", and made it possible fo r workers to submit their certified agreements directly to Workplace Authority rather than going through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There were also clauses in WorkChoices that made it harder for workers to strike, made it easier for em ployers to force their employees onto individual workplace agreements rather than collective agreements, and banning clauses from workplace agreements which supported trade unions. The Workplace Relations Act 1996, as amended by the Workplace Relations Ame ndment Act 2005 , or WorkChoices , which came into effect in March 2006, was a comprehensive change to industrial relations in Australia. 2. United Kingdom 187 United Kingdom labour law is that body of law which regulates the rights, and obligations of trade unions , workers and employers in the United Kingdom. Labour law, often also referred to as \"employment law\" has developed rapidly over the past forty years, due to a historically strong trades union movement and the United Kingdom's membership of the European Un ion (since 1973). In its current form, it is largely a creature of statute rather than Common Law. Leading employment law statutes include the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Employment Act 2002 and various legislative provisions outlawing discrimination o n the grounds of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, and religion and from 2006, age. The operation of the Employment Law system is broadly similar across the whole of the UK, although there are some differences in the common law between England & W ales and Scotland and, in addition, Northern Ireland has extra anti -discrimination legislation dealing with discrimination on the grounds of religion, community affiliation or political affiliation, which is quite distinct from the laws on religious discri mination in Great Britain. The labour related laws of UK are  Employment Rights Act, 1996  Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, 1974  National Minimum Wage Act, 1998  Fixed -Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002  Equality Act, 2006  Sex Discrimination Act 1975  Equal Pay Act 1970  Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations, 2003  Disability Discrimination Act, 1995  Trade Union Act", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

China Labour Law in the People's Republic of China has become a very hot issue with the soaring numbers of factories and the fast pace of urbanization. The basic labour laws are the Labour Law of People's Republic of China (promulgated on 5 J uly 1994) and the Law of the People's Republic of China on Employment Contracts (Adopted at the 28th Session of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People's Congress on June 29, 2007, Effective from January 1, 2008). The administrative regulations enacted by the State Council, the ministerial rules and the judicial explanations of the Supreme People’s Court stipulate detailed rules concerning the various aspects of the employment relationship. Labour Union in China is controlled by the government through the All China Federation of Trade Unions, which is also the sole legal labour union in Mainland China. Strike is formally legal, but in fact is strictly forbidden. According to the new 98 -article -long \"Labor Contract Law\", employees of at least 10 ye ars standing are entitled to contracts that protect them from being dismissed without cause. The new law also requires employers to contribute to employees' social security accounts and sets wage standards for employees on probation and working overtime. China's new labor contract law targets, primarily domestic companies that do not have labor contracts and that generally fail to comply with China's old laws. Foreign companies have had a stronger track record of signing contracts with employees and bringin g to China their global work rules and environmental, health and safety practices. 4. France In France the first labour laws were Waldeck Rousseau's laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the Popular Front enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each ye ar of paid vacation for workers, and a law limiting the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The Grenelle accords negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union section s in each enterprise. The minimum wage was also increased by 25%. In 2000 Lionel Jospin's government then enacted the 35 -hour workweek, down from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister Dominique de Villepin enacted the New Employment Contr act (CNE).

In 2006 he then attempted to pass the First Emplo yment Contract (CPE) through a 189 vote by emergency procedure, but that it was met by students and unions' protests. President Jacques Chirac finally had no choice but to repeal it. 5. United States of America United States labour law is a heterogeneous collecti on of state and federal laws. Federal law not only sets the standards that govern workers' rights to organize in the private sector, but overrides most state and local laws that attempt to regulate this area. Federal law also provides more limited rights f or employees of the federal government. These federal laws do not, on the other hand, apply to employees of state and local governments, agricultural workers or domestic employees; any statutory protections those workers have derived from state law. Both f ederal and state laws protect workers from employment discrimination. In most areas these two bodies of law overlap; as an example, federal law permits state to enact their own statutes barring discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, nationa l origin and age, so long as the state law does not provide less protections than federal law would. Federal law, on the other hand, preempts most state statutes that would bar employers from discriminating against employees to prevent them from obtaining pensions or other benefits or retaliating against them for asserting those rights. Federal law does not provide employees of state and local governments with the right to organize or engage in union activities, except to the extent that the United States Constitution protects their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association. The Constitution provides even less protection for governmental employees' right to engage in collective bargaining: while it bars public employers from retaliating against employees for forming a union, it does not require those employers to recognize that union, much less bargain with it. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) establishes minimum wage and overtime rights for most private sector workers, with a number o f exemptions and exceptions. Congress amended the Act in 1974 to cover governmental employees. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act establishes standards for the funding and operation of pension and health care plans provided by employers to their e mployees. 190 The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, requires employers to provide workers with twelve weeks of unpaid medical leave and continuing medical benefit coverage in order to attend to certain medical conditions of close relatives or thems", "source": "data\\raw\\Labour Act.pdf", "url": null, "filename": "Labour Act.pdf"}

The Occupational Safety and Health Act, signed into law in 1970 by President Richard Nixon, creates specific standards for workplace safety. The Act also provides for protection for \"whistleblowers\" who complain to governmental authorities about uns afe conditions while allowing workers the right to refuse to work under unsafe conditions in certain circumstances. The Act allows states to take over the administration of OSHA in their jurisdictions, so long as they adopt state laws at least as protectiv e of workers' rights as under federal law.

Restriction repugna nt to interest created. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest ther ein is created absolutely in favour of any person, but the terms of the transfer direct that such interest shall be applied or enjoyed by him in a particular manner, he shall be entitled to receive and dispose of such interest as if there were no such direction. 1[Where any such direction has been made in respect of one piece of immoveable property for the purpose of securing the beneficial enjoyment of another piece of such property, nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any right which the transferor may have to enforce such direction or any remedy which he may have in respect of a breach thereof.] 12.

Transfer for benefit of unborn person. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at the date of the transfer, subject to a prior interest created by the same transfer, the interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect, unless it extends to the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor in the property. 1. Subs. by Act 20 of 1929, s. 8, for the second paragraph. 12 Illustration A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended wife succesively for their lives, and, aft er the death of the survivor for the eldest son of the intended marriage fo r life, and after his death for A's second son. The interest so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, because it does not extend to the whole of A's remaining inte rest in the property. 14. Rule against perpetuity .—No transfer of p roperty can operate to create an interest which is to take effect after the lifetime of one or more persons living at the date of such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong. 15. Transfer to class some of whom come under sections 13 and 14. —If, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a class of persons with regard to some of whom such interest fails by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14; such interest fails 1[in regard to those persons only and not in regard to the whole class]. 2[16.

Direction for accumulation .—(1) Where the terms of a transfer of property direct that the income arising from the property shall be accumulated either wholly or in part during a period longer than— (a) the life of the transferor, or (b) a period of eighteen years from the date of the transfer, such direction shall, save as hereinafter provided, be void to the extent to which the period during which the accumulation is directed exceeds the longer of the aforesaid periods, and at the end of such last -mentioned period the property and the income thereof shall be disposed of as if the period during which the accumulation has been directed to be made had elapsed. (2) This section shall not affect any directio n for accumulation for the purpose of — (i) the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any interest under the transfer, or (ii) the provision of portions for children or remoter issue of the transferor or of any other person takin g any interest under the transfer, or (iii) the preservation or maintenance of the property transferred; and such direction may be made accordingly. 18.

A vested interest is not defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession. Explanation. —An intention that an interest shall not be vested is not to be inferred merely -from a provision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed, or whereby a prior interest in the same property is given or reserved to some other person, or whereby income arising from the property is 1.

When unborn person acquires vested interest on transfer for his benefit .—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not then living, he acquires upon his birth, unless a contrary intention appear from the terms of the transfer, a vested interest, although he may not be entitled to the enjoyment thereof immediately on his bi rth. 21. Contingent interest. —Where , on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person to take effect only on the happening of a specified uncertain event, or if a specified uncertain event shall not happen, such person thereb y acquires a contingent interest in the property. Such interest becomes a vested interest, in the former case, on the happening of the event, in the latter, when the happening of the event becomes impossible. Exception. —Where, under a transfer of property, a person becomes entitled to an interest therein upon attaining a particular age, and the transferor also gives to him absolutely the income to arise from such interest before he reaches that age, or directs the income or so much thereof as may be necessa ry to be applied for his benefit, such interest is not contingent. 22. Transfer to members of a class who attain a particular age. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of such members only of a class as shall attain a particular age, such interest does not vest in any member of the class who has not attained that age. 23. Transfer contingent on happening of specified uncertain event. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to a specified perso n if a specified uncertain event shall happen, and no time is mentioned for the occurrence of that event, the interest fails unless such event happens before, or at the same time as, the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist. 24. Transfer to such of certain persons as survive at some period not specified .—Where , on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to such of certain persons as shall be surviving at some period, but the exact period is not specified, the interest shall go to such of them as shall be alive when the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer.

Illustration A transfers property to B for life, and after his death to C and D, equally to be divided between them, or to the survivor of them. C dies during the life of B. D survives B . At B's death the property passes to D. 25. Conditional transfer. —An interest created on a transfer of property and dependent upon a condition fails if the fulfilment of the condition is impossible, or is forbidden by law, or is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent, or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or the Court rega rds it as immoral or opposed to public policy. Illustrations (a) A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an hour. The lease is void. (b) A gives Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall marry A's daughter C. At the d ate of the transfer C was dead. The transfer is void. (c) A transfers Rs. 500 to B or condition that she shall murder C. The transfer is void. (d) A transfer s Rs. 500 to his n iece C if she will desert her husband. The transfer is void. 26. Fulfilment of condition precedent. —Where the terms of a transfer of property impose a condition to be fulfilled before a person can take an interest in the property, the condition shall be deemed to have been fulfilled if it has been substantially complied with. Illustr ations (a) A transfers Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D, and E. E dies. B marries with the consent of C and D. B is deemed to have fulfilled the condition. (b) A transfers Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall ma rry with the consent of C, D and E. B marries without the consent of C, D and E, but obtains their consent after the marriage. B has not fulfilled the condition. 14 27. Conditional transfer to one person coupled with transfer to another on failure of prior disposition .—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and by the same transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the prior disposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of the prior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the transferor.

But, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ulterior disposition shall take effect only in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not take effect unless the prior disposi tion fails in that manner. Illustrations (a) A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after A ’s death, and, if he should neglect to do so, to C. B dies in A's life -time. The disposition in favour of C takes effect. (b) A transfers property to his wife; but, in case she should die in his life -time, transfers to B that which he had transferred to her. A and his wife perish together, under circumstances which make it impossible to prove that she died befor e him. The disposition in favour of B does not take effect. 28. Ulterior transfer conditional on happening or not happening of specified event .—On a transfer of property an interest therein may be created to accrue to any person with the condition superadd ed that in case a specified uncertain event shall happen such interest shall pass to another person, or that in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen such interest shall pass to another person. In each case the dispositions are subject to the r ules contained in sections 10, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27. 29. Fulfilment of condition subsequent .—An ulterior disposition of the kind contemplated by the last preceding section cannot take effect unless the condition is strictly fulfilled. Illustration A transfers Rs. 500 to B, to be paid to him on his attaining his majority or marrying, with a proviso that, if B dies a minor or marries without C's consent, the Rs. 500 shall go to D. B marries when only 17 years of age, without C's consent. The transfer to D takes effect. 30. Prior disposition not affected by invalidity of ulterior disposition .—If the ulterior disposition is not valid, the prior disposition is not affected by it. Illustration A transfers a farm to B for her life, and, if she do not deser t her husband to C. B is entitled to the farm during her life as if no condition had been inserted. 31.

Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens or does not happen .—Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein may be created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen. Illustrations (a) A trans fers a farm to B for his life, with a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He loses his life -interest in the farm. (b) A transfers a farm to B, provided that, if B shall not go to England within three years after the date of the transfer, his interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the term prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases. 32. Such condition must not be invalid .—In order that a condition that an interest shall cease to exist may be valid, it is necessary that the event to which it relates be one which could legally constitute the condition of the creation of an interest. 33. Transfer conditional on performance of act, no time being specifi ed for performance .—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created subject to a condition that the person taking it shall perform a certain act, but no time is specified for the performance of the act, the conditi on is broken when he renders impossible, permanently or for an indefinite period, the performance of the act. 34. Transfer conditional on performance of act, time being specified .—Where an act is to be performed by a person either as a condition to be fulf illed before an interest created on a transfer of 15 property is enjoyed by him, or as a condition on the non -fulfillment of which the interest is to pass from him to another person, and a time is specified for the performance of the act, if such performance within the specified time is prevented by the fraud of a person who would be directly benefited by non -fulfilment of the condition, such further time shall as against him be allowed for performing the act as shall be requisite to make up for the delay caus ed by such fraud. But if no time is specified for the performance of the act, then, if its performance is by the fraud of a person interested in the non -fulfilment of the condition rendered impossible or indefinitely postponed, the condition shall as again st him be deemed to have been fulfilled.

Election 35. Election when necessary .—Where a person professes to transfer property which he has no right to transfer, and as part of the same transaction confers any benefit on the owner of the property, such owner must elect either to confirm such transfer or to dissent from it; and in the latter case he shall relinquish the benefit so conferred, and the benefit so relinquished shall revert to the transferor or his representative as if it had not been disposed of, subject nevertheless, where the transfer is gratuitous, and the transferor has, before the election, died or otherwise become incapable of making a fresh transfer, and in all cases where the transfer is for consideration, to the charge of making good to th e disappointed transferee the amount or value of the property attempted to be transferred to him. Illustrations The farm of Sultanpur is the property of C and worth Rs. 800. A by an instrument of gift professes to transfer it to B, givin g by the same instr ument Rs. 1,000 to C. C elects to retain the farm. He forfeits the gift of Rs. 1,000. In the same case, A dies before the election. His representative must out of the Rs. 1,000 pay Rs. 800 to B. The rule in the first paragraph of this section applies whether the transferor does or does not believe that which he professes to transfer to be his own. A person taking no benefit directly under a transaction, but deriving a benefit under it indirectly, need not elect. A person who in his one capacity takes a benefit under the transaction may in another dissent therefrom. Exception to the last preceding four rules. —Where a particular benefit is expressed to be conferred on the owner of the property which the transferor professes to transfer, and such benefit i s expressed to be in lieu of that property, if such owner claim the property, he must relinquish the particular benefit, but he is not bound to relinquish any other benefit conferred upon him by the same transaction. Acceptance of the benefit by the person on whom it is conferred constitutes an election by him to confirm the transfer, if he is aware of his duty to elect and of those circumstances which would influence the judgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives enquiry into the c ircumstances. Such knowledge or waiver shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed, if the person on whom the benefit has been conferred has enjoyed it for two years without doing any act to express dissent.

Such knowledge of waiver may be inferred from any act of his which renders it impossible to place the persons interested in the property professed to be transferred in the same condition as if such act had not been done. Illustration A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal -mine. C takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the transfer of the estate to B. 16 If he does not within one year after the date of the transfer signify to the transferor or hi s representatives his intention to confirm or to dissent from the transfer, the transferor or his representative may, upon the expiration of that period, require him to make his election; and, if he does not comply with such requisition within a reasonable time after he has received it, he shall be deemed to have elected to confirm the transfer. In case of disability, the election shall be postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made by some competent authority. Appointment 36. Appor tionment of periodical payments determination of interest of person entitled .—In the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary, all rents annuities, pensions, dividends and other periodical payments in the nature of income shall, upon the transf er of the interest of the person entitled to receive such payments, be deemed, as between the transferor and the transferee, to accrue due from day to day, and to be apportionable accordingly, but to be payable on the days appointed for the payment thereof . 37. Apportionment of benefit of obligation on severance .—When, in consequence of a transfer, property is divided and held in several shares, and thereupon the benefit of any obligation relating to the property as a whole passes from one to several owners of the property, the corresponding duty shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary amongst the owners, be performed in favour of each of such owners in proportion to the value of his share in the property, provided that the duty can be severed an d that the severance does not substantially increase the burden of the obligation; but if the duty cannot be severed, or if the severance would substantially increase the burden of the obligation the duty shall be performed for the benefit of such one of t he several owners as they shall jointly designate for that purpose: Provided that no person on whom the burden of the obligation lies shall be", "source": "data\\raw\\THE TRANSFER OF PROPERTY ACT, 1882 .pdf", "url": null, "filename": "THE TRANSFER OF PROPERTY ACT, 1882 .pdf"}

(b) In the same case, each house in the village being bound to provide ten days' labour each year on a d yke to prevent inundation , E had agreed as a term of his lease to perform this work for A. B, C and D severally require E to perform the ten days' work due on account of the house of each. E is not bound to do more than ten days' work in all, according to such direc tions as B, C and D may join in giving. (B) Transfer of Immovable property 38. Transfer by person authorised only under certain circumstances to transfer .—Where any person, authori sed only under circumstances in their nature variable to dispose of immoveable property, transfers such property for consideratio n, alleging the existence of such circumstances, they shall, as between the transferee on the one part and the transferor and other persons (if any) affected by the transfer on the other part, be deemed to have existed, if the transferee, after using reaso nable care to ascertain the existence of such circumstances, has acted in good faith. Illustration A, a Hindu widow, whose husband has left collateral heirs, alleging that the property held by her as such is insufficient for her maintenance, agrees, for pu rposes neither religious nor charitable, to sell a field, part of such property, to B. B satisfies himself by reasonable enquiry that the income of the property is insufficient for A's maintenance, and that the sale of the f ield is necessary, and acting in good faith, buys the field from A.

Burden of obligation imposing restriction on use of land .—Where, for the more beneficial enjoyment of his own immoveable property, a third person has, independently of any interest in the immoveable property of another or of any easement thereon, a right to restrain the enjoyment2 [in a particular manner of the latter property], or or of obligation annexed to ownership but not amounting to interest or easement .—where a third person is entitled to the benefit of an obligation arising out of contract and annexed to the ownership of immoveable property, but not amounting to an interest therein or easeme nt thereon, such right or obligation may be enforced against a transferee with notice thereof or a gratuitous transferee of the property affected thereby, but not against a transferee for consideration and without notice of the right or obligation, nor aga inst such property in his hands. Illustration A contracts to sell Sultanpur to B. While the contract is still in force he sells Sultanpur to C, who has notice of the contr act.

Illustration A lets a house to B, and reserves power to revoke the lease if, in the opinion of a specified surveyor, B should make a use of it detrimental to its value. Afterwards A, thinking that such a use has been made, lets the house to C. This operates as a revocati on of B's lease subject to the opinion of the surveyor as to B's use of the house having been detrimental to its value . 43. Transfer by unauthori sed person who subsequently acquires interest in property transferred .—Where a person 3[fraudulently or] errone ously represents that he is authori sed to transfer certain immovable property and professes to transfer such property for consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of transfer subsists.
